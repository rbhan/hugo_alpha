*for the full time NA Insights Analyst position; this role roughly translates to business intelligence analyst at other companies, and I would specifically be working in NA Publishing*

## Phone screen (8/2)

Short call with a Sourcing Recruiter, mostly discussed my motivations for interviewing, my interest in Riot/League, also touched on a few experiences from my resume.

## Remote interview 1 (8/8)

Hour long video call with two Rioters -- a Senior Analyst from the R&D team and an Insights Manger.  The Senior Analyst led the interview, but the Insights manager stepped in throughout to ask thought-provoking clarifications that forced me to delve deeper.

Short standalone math question, followed by a case study around the landing and reception of the rehauled Honour system, specifically breaking down their definition of success and which quantitative metrics they should monitor to gauge the success of the system. Concluded with a couple of behavioural questions about my proudest achievement, and a time when I had an uncomfortable (one-on-one) conversation.

## Remote interview 2 (8/16)

Hour long video call with an Insights Analyst (working specifically on player growth). Three math questions about statistics/probability; I blanked on Bayes theorem and fumbled slightly to derive it, but eventually arrived at the answer. Short, math-heavy case about optimizing price points for champion skins.

## Remote interview 3 (8/21)

Hour long video call with the Insights Manager I met in one of the earlier calls -- he was also the person whom I would be working for if I were accepted for the position. We had time after the interview to discuss his projects in more detail, and what project(s) I might start on.

The interview started with a behavioural question about a time when I went against popular opinion, and the last time someone got mad at me. Followed with a case on Riot strategy and investment in League Esports. I glossed over revenue/profitability (obvious mistake in retrospect) and focused mostly on intangible/influence based buckets. Finally, I was asked to discuss what I hoped to learn from and bring to Riot.

## On-site all day interview (9/11)

I was given a schedule ahead of time with four interview plus lunch and a tour. Besides knowing that I would start the day with a case presentation, however, I had no idea what to expect for my other interviews.

For the case presentation, I had 50 minutes to review a packet of data and prepare a recommendation for or against unlocking all champions in ARAM. I was given 15 minutes to present this to a panel of four, some of whom I had met over video. This was really cool; I went in biased towards unlocking all champions (something I gripe about as a player), but after reviewing all the data, it was clear why Riot has not done this yet -- keeping the pool locked remains the best business decision.

Second interview was also a case study with a Principal Analyst, although much more open-ended than previous studies. Question about rehauling the Tutorial, focusing specifically on what quantitative metrics I would want to measure and how data would inform my decisions. This was a great interview, the most challenging one yet, and how it really forced me to think through specific on-the-job scenarios.

Final two interviews were two rounds of behavioural interviews. First was with my Insights Manager and a Product Lead from Insights. It was a little difficult (since this was my third or fourth interview with my Insights Manager) to remember what stories I had already told him. Second round was with a Player Growth Lead and the Director of Insights. The two rounds managed to span nearly exclusive question spaces; I revisited some of the same stories, but different facets (e.g. team dynamic vs client dynamic) within those.

As my all-day interview, I was expecting it to be grueling but it was actually chill and fun! The cases were very relevant to League and it was fascinating to see Riot's perspective behind many of their decisions (which is exactly why I applied). [Having an offer in hand]( {{<relref "2018-09-07-job-interviews-mckinsey.md">}} ) also took off a lot of the pressure so I was able to fully enjoy meeting the team and exploring the campus.

## Remote interview 4 (9/21)

Hour long video call with Head of NA Regional office, was asked about my previous experiences and especially teamwork / conflict-resolution scenarios. There was some overlap with questions from the previous on-site interview. Seemed unusual to have more interviews after I already visited in person, but I enjoyed speaking to a high-level decision maker in the company.

## Remote interview 5 (9/25)

This was the 'Sponsor Interview'. Hour long video call with (a different) Director of Insights / Product Lead / Head of Talent Acquisition. Was mostly asked about my interest in industry/Riot/Insights and a bunch of questions about my greatest weaknesses, mistakes I made, my "darkest moment". Felt like an odd conversation to have at this final stage in the interview process.

Interesting to hear that Riot Games wants to be "the Marvel of video games, except not owned by Disney". I did get the message throughout that Riot is trying to establish themselves as gaming company first, League company second.

Received an acceptance email later that week, and immediate follow-up from several of my interviewers who would be supervising me in this role.

# Takeaway

Having only prior experience with management consulting, I was surprised to have so many interviews (10 conversations total, spread out over almost two months). It felt a little excessive, but everyone I spoke to was warm, welcoming, and encouraging. For the most part, Riot was also very prompt at getting back to me with a decision.

The compensation was about what I'd expect for a similar position at one of the [Big 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms), they have neat benefits/perks on par with software engineering companies (including an interesting alternative to stock options), and there are promising growth opportunities within the organization.

They strike a highly attractive balance between laid-back and high-impact workplace atmosphere. All the Rioters I met were wonderful (and I appreciate the time/manpower dedicated to the entire interview process), they are dedicated to the "work hard, play hard" mentality, and any job where I am encouraged (even expected) to play League during the workday is a win. It's also an exciting time to be at Riot -- they're really thinking about defining their identity as a content company but also as a leader in the greater trend of Esports.
