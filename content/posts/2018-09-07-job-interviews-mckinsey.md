*for a full time Associate position; indicated interest in Generalist and Digital McKinsey tracks with Generalist preference* 

## Round 1 (8/23)

Two interviews at the local office, 15 minutes to delve into one personal experience (PEI) question followed by 25 minutes with a business case.

First interview was over video conference with a long-time McK consultant and EM. The VC quality was fantastic; great latency and camera resolution, basically felt no different than talking face to face. PEI question about leading a team through a difficult time, whether in an official leadership position or not. Very thought provoking follow-up questions about the specifics of two key/pivotal conversations. Fairly straightforwards case about a snack foods company entering a new market. Based on interviewer response, I may have fumbled my analysis of the first exhibit (although not egregiously). There was a typo on the second exhibits which became relevant during the math portion.

Second interview was also with an EM. We chatted casually about my resume for a few minutes before jumping into the PEI. The interviewer mentioned they knew what PEI question I had been given during the first interview, and that this question was similar but I should avoid using the same story. I was asked to discuss how I handled a situation where someone disagreed with me. Again, targeted questions about particulars of certain conversations. Growth case about a sporting goods retail company. More room for a little creativity in this case. I could have tied the quantitative analysis back to the problem statement in a more insightful way (which I realized immediately after giving my summary, of course).

Received a call the next day, early afternoon, inviting me to a decision round at my first office preference. Was given the feedback that I demonstrated good comprehensive case structure and ability to tie conclusions back to the problem at hand. I was a little nervous during my first round interviews and it showed; the interviewer encouraged me to approach my final round interviews more calmly and with confidence.

## Final Round (9/7)

Three interviews with my first choice office, same format as the first round. There was definitely more opportunity to get to know my interviewers better than during the first round (more time for introductions/questions?) A candidate reception the previous evening was also a fantastic chance to meet the office and talk casually with consultants one-on-one.

First interview was with an AP. PEI question about the hardest thing I have done, and/or my proudest accomplishment (doing something difficult). I had to divert a bit from my "prepared" stories and delve into a more complex situation with mixed outcomes, but the follow-up questions helped guide the story and bring out the challenges / lessons learned more clearly. Incredibly interesting case about an internal McK initiative looking at gender inequality. My structuring was quite MECE, and the math was fairly straightforwards.

Second interview was with a Partner. I was asked to reflect on a time when I had to influence/persuade a team to agree with me. The case was about increasing funding for a conservatory. While my structure was MECE, I didn't feel that I was particularly creative with it. I also initially misunderstood some of the given information for the math question and spent more time than I should have on that part of the case. However, my interviewer reassured me this was a new case and the first time giving it.

Third interview was with a Senior Manager who had been with the firm for 23+ years; it was great to learn more about their experiences afterwards! The PEI question was about leading a team with multiple conflicting members of a team through a situation; follow-up questions were very detailed, really helped to bring out the nuances of the different players involved. Really fun case about growing revenues for the game industry -- I loved thinking about this and my structure was extensively MECE, with good creativity. The quantitative analysis was also fun, in that it affirmed some of my hypotheses but other aspects were surprising.

Received a call back that evening with an offer, very awesome.

# Takeaway

McK felt like a better fit for me, based on Insight (over Bridge to BCG), and the interview format was much easier for me to showcase my thinking (on PEI questions in particular). While preparing the experience stories, I realized in retrospect why BCG might have thought my fit stories lacked depth. On the other hand, BCG asks 4-5 fit questions to be answered in 15 minutes where McK devotes the entire time to one story; so I am still unclear what an appropriate level of detail would have been.

McK also provided warm, helpful, and welcoming support for the second round. The recruiting team asked in detail about my interests and hobbies in order to "personalize" my final round interviewers so I could connect with them. Multiple partners from different (unrelated) offices reached out to introduce themselves and their specialties at the firm. I was put in touch with a "buddy" from my interview office with a similar background.
