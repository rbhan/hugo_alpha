<img style="float: right; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="/img/DDayfrog.jpg" /> Today is the 75th anniversary of D-Day; possibly one of the last anniversaries with remaining WWII veterans. Surprisingly, there is no commemorative Google Doodle to mark the occasion -- though there was one celebrating the [60th anniversary of a National Park](https://www.google.com/doodles/60th-anniversary-of-torres-del-paine-national-park), [50 years of pride](https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-50-years-of-pride), and even an upcoming sketch planned for [Lucky Akhand's 63rd birthday](https://www.google.com/doodles/lucky-akhands-63rd-birthday). In this, Russia [agrees](https://www.newsweek.com/russia-d-day-troll-normandy-anniversary-75-nazi-allies-victory-1442493) that D-Day is not worth all the hullabaloo. But hey, the boys over at /r/sabaton [know](https://www.reddit.com/r/sabaton/comments/bxf4u8/i_can_finally_share_my_spotify_playlist_to/) [what's](https://www.reddit.com/r/sabaton/comments/bxfhni/meme_number_8_is_12_minutes_late_i_apologise_but/) [up](https://www.reddit.com/r/sabaton/comments/bxiqsv/primo_victoria/)!
