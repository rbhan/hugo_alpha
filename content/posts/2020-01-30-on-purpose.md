I bought a domain 2 years ago and made a commitment to post something once a month. It was less a desire to communicate and more of an exercise in building discipline. Having since demonstrated that I can half-ass an update every ±30 days, I'm setting my sights higher this year: define a purpose, or at least a (consistent) voice.

[Julian Shapiro's Writing Well](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/introductions) is an ambitious guide. It aims to produce writing more structured and deliberate than anything I intended when I began this blog. 

He breaks purpose into __objective__ (the 'so what?') and __motivation__ (the 'why?'). The order is significant; while I post for my own motivation, no one else will read it unless they're given an incentive to care, such as

* Opening people’s eyes by proving the status quo wrong
* Articulating something everyone’s thinking about but no one is saying
* Identifying key trends on a topic and making a prediction about the future
* Contributing original insights through research and experimentation
* Distilling an overwhelming topic into something approachable
* Sharing a solution to a tough problem
* Telling a suspenseful and emotional story that imparts a lesson


Shapiro suggests reasons why one might be driven to write

* Does writing this article get something off your chest?
* Does it help reason through a nagging, unsolved problem you have?
* Does it persuade others to do something you believe is important?
* Do you obsess over the topic and want others to geek out over it too?


Finally he touches on __style__, which he decomposes into 3 components

* Voice (tone, sense of humour, eccentricities, and viewpoints)
* Presentation (use of analogies, anecdotes, humour, or multimedia)
* Creativity (delighting readers with poetic thought and language)

As a reader, I probably over-index on style; I like reading to learn, but I obsessively read as intimacy. I'm drawn to writers for their personality expressed in their style. I make it an immersive experience. I seek out their entire corpus, biographies about them if available. Style is the _je ne sais quoi_ that differentiates authors.

I don't have a consistent style, spoken or written. I tend to pick up someone's voice if I spend enough time talking to them or consuming pieces they've written (NLP style transfer?). Developing a consistent style is dangerous. Committing to any kind of identifiable personality is dangerous, because it polarizes the response. Style is why author's have fans and haters.

Given that I'm treating this as an exercise, I may as well practice professional clarity (aspirationally Paul Graham, though even someone as crisp as him, must still contend with [haters](http://www.paulgraham.com/kedrosky.html)). Until further consideration, I'm writing for myself. The objective is to leave frequent records of my thinking for later revisiting -- which also requires building a different kind of discipline to not revise older posts, no matter how cringe.
