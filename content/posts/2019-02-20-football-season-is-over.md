**The Good Doctor Speaks Again: A Decompression Notice for the Departing Class at Ford.  
_[-- Hunter S. Thompson via GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/)_**

There had been five or nine very long rainstorms in the past few weeks, I felt it was necessary to follow the normal pattern of showers every few hours for at least an hour, going over the side and staying at the hotel until dark by telephone.

On Wednesday morning I got dressed and went downstairs. Torrential downpours washing all the stinking human filth of Home Park into 10th and State. The sidewalks were submerged somewhere beneath the cesspool of crushed glass, used needles and venereal disease.

I thought about the rapid fox living nearby. Plastic signs blocked off either end of a footpath: DO NOT ENTER -- FOX ATTACKS REPORTED -- MAY HAVE RABIES -- WILL TRAVEL. That didn't seem right, but nothing is convincing with psychomimetic agents. The early frontiersmen called it hydrophobia: terror in this tropical rainstorm.

"We can’t both make it across," I said to my colleague grimly. "But seeing as it's essential I get there on time, and dry, why don’t you lie down here: I'll cross on your back and send for assistance right away: we'll need a barge at this rate."

I was shoving him towards the street but he flailed and clawed wildly. "You’re out of your mind!" He was panting, waving a sodden branch at me to fend off my jabs. "Why don’t we take my car?"

"Sharks? There aren't any sharks, they wouldn't last a day in this. No more excuses now," I insisted, "don't you want to help an old friend?"

"No no, I said my CAR --" he screamed. I surprised him with a powerful check, sending him sprawling face first into the muck. "I'd be careful about what I call business metaphors, pal," I muttered.

The trick was to send the Committee into diabetic shock before I started talking. I would sit at a table right next to somebody, and just stare at them -- for all the wrong reasons -- and they'd nod at me, too tense to smile. "Any questions?" I would ask and they would stare back bug-eyed and silent, frothing lightly at the mouth. "No? Excellent, excellent, thank you very much:"

A strange, phoneless murmur among the crowd today. The Colonel had managed to make himself unattractive to the public, but he had no stomach for women either. He was so groovy in his new bodyguard's presence that even a cab driver with glasses couldn't miss a beat.

I had a bag of Gypsy pills from the special dispenser right behind me. They took the pills with a huge smile on their faces for two or three seconds, then looked at each other again and said, "We'll give this a ride."

But Something was Wrong. The Committee was awake and in a nasty mood, their facial expressions were so ominous that it was hard to believe them. "We know all that already!" they grunted and snarled, leathery necks lunging forth. "What about the packing? Or the grinding? How would that change the peaks?"

I was sweating, hysterical, thick beads: how long, O Lord, how long!

My mind was getting faster, my head felt like a giant teddible. Thinking quickly, I listed off a few lists about earth-life support, food, lodging and energy -- then start raving again. But it never even came up.

Too early to tell, but there is a lot of talk about the ceiling, the colors: they might not call me a pro, but when they do it is usually a deal-breaker.

My advisor stares straight ahead. “Congratulations, Doctor,” he says. “We saw a great many you.” My Committee? Who was it with them?

I recall being told, for the first time, that I was the Holy Grail of my class. As a matter of fact, I remember telling somebody later that I was his whole class, even going so far as to tell one of my professors that I was his whole classroom at one point, too.

Another half-finished story, another one of stranded and desperate people, another twisted cremation at the circus. I think people perceive that from my finished product, those are two totally different things. All they need is a little edge and a certain amount of courage.

Well, it depends on what you mean by my personal margin of victory. You can argue about that, for sure, but I guarantee there are some things you can win without much:The ego has always been my bag of worst fears. I hate to admit this sightlessly, but I have learned to live with it. I now declare it a habit, a luxury and a reward to me. I've been very confident in my performance.
