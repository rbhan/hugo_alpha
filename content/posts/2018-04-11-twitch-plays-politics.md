Having spent the better part of two days watching Zuckerberg testify before Congress, I can only hope that all future hearings will also be on Twitch. Streaming the event was a fantastic and (in retrospect) obviously sensible decision; Jeff Bezos owns the company that owns Washington Post, and Amazon acquired Twitch back in 2014.

Twitch chat is unlike most other online communities. During both of the five hour sessions, channel activity fluctuated around ten thousand views. When viewership reaches some critical mass (already exceeded in the pre-stream lobby), chat becomes totally troll though mostly harmless. There are griefers, but they get drowned out rapidly. The chatbar scrolls too quickly for toxicity to stick -- only memes have traction, from Zuck's [MrDestructoid](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/28/3.0) blinking to his [KomodoHype](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/81273/3.0) or the general [KKona](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/248/322/e27.png) spam.

In the last episode of [Philip K Dick's Electric Dreams](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075NTXMN9) (Amazon's answer to Black Mirror), a man finds himself increasingly alienated in a society where he alone notices the political Candidate's worrying call to action on national television.

Twitch broadcasting reassures me that particular dystopia is unlikely. Chat is irrepressibly irreverent. The more serious the adults, the more chat LULs. OMEGALUL if someone says anything unsound, bizarre, or straight up asinine. The emperor's new clothes? He's not wearing any clothes, [KappaPride](https://static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v1/55338/3.0).

It also encourages engagement with important but boring civic events that many of the viewers might not otherwise watch. I had never watched an AIPAC or RNC prior to the 2016 summits, which were also streamed on Twitch (and also the debut of &'Zodiac Killer' Ted Cruz). Chat was mordantly funny, but also unexpectedly astute.

I don't typically watch television and instead rely on CNN talking heads or NYT pundits to digest the salient points. But that isn't fully informative or even efficient. Especially when big media seems to be in tacit agreement on which headlines to promote and which to depress. It wasn't until earlier this afternoon that US-Russia tensions over Syria bombings made first page (still below the fold) on many US papers. And that likely only happened because of the President's early morning tweets.

Accuracy is critical when reporting on internationally delicate affairs, but it's awkward when /pol/ has a better measure on the pulse of global 'happenings' than the press.

Were we to encourage real-time news discussion that doesn't get divisive because all comments are (implicitly) ended with Kappa, I believe there would be an audience for it. Anonymity is not always bad and a more regulated Facebook is definitely not the solution. If anything, a decentralized and anonymous news channel might fix many of the user privacy issues discussed ad nauseum.

Everybody knows by now that Facebook relies on outrage to generate more clicks and shares and user interaction. If we were all a little more blithe and a little less earnest online, 'bad actors' would find us less easily exploitable. This may require a new generational paradigm (the Twitch chat generation?) of internet as virtual reality, although if we learned anything from Zuckerberg's two days on Capitol Hill, it's that half the generations aren't sure what internet is anyway.
