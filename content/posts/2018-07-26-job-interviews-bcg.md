*for a full time Generalist Consultant position; applied as an advanced degree candidate (ADC), also received a follow-up invitation to be considered for BCG Gamma based on background fit*

**First Round (7/13)**

Two interviews in the local office. First one with a Project Leader. Fit questions included the standard "Tell me about yourself", "Why consulting?" but also "What was your best team experience and what made it the best?" Case was about improving profits in the poultry retail industry. After dancing around different sources of raw material, the interviewer eventually just told me that retailers can buy from poultry brokers. Math part of the case was fairly simple optimization.

Second one with a Principal. Fit questions included "Tell me about a time when it was your fault something went wrong, and how did you resolve it?" Interesting case with a strong creativity/brainstorming component, about growing sales and finding new revenue streams for a fashion magazine. We dived straight into the first exhibit off of a clarifying question. Although I did get around to all the majour insights, in hindsight I should have outlined a basic framework immediately after receiving the prompt.

Feedback for first round: I brought a lot of bright personable energy and enthusiasm into the room. My fit responses were good, but should be "tightened up". The case portion could have used more structuring and I did not walk the interviewer through the math calculations clearly enough.

**Decision Round (7/20)**

BCG got back to me within 24 business hours. The decision round was a week after the first round. Two interviews; surprisingly, both with Principals (I was told to prepare for at least one Partner). Also surprisingly, the cases seemed more routine than the first round cases -- not necessarily easier, but certainly more similar to prep case examples. Full disclosure though, considering I did not receive an offer, it is possible the emphasis here was more on how well I fit with the firm (evidently not well enough, more on that later).

First interview had the standard fit questions -- background, why consulting, an example of a time I had to change someone's mind, and leadership philosophy. Fairly standard new product/project case for the aerospace material testing industry. There were a few extra minutes at the end to chat with the interviewer; I really enjoyed our conversation and thought we connected very well.

Second interview was with one of the recruiting officers who was also a Principal. I thought I had strong reasons for the "Why consulting" and "Which practice / office" fit (these being issues I have considered in depth). A following question about my "teamwork style" caught me off guard; I ought to have asked for a minute to thoughtfully consider an answer, or at least clarified what the interviewer was asking. The case was pretty simple, more or less profitability optimization among three advertisement options. As soon as I wrote down my framework, I realized there was a better way of structuring the solution, but went with what I had written in the interest of time. There was no executive summary so it felt like we ended abruptly, although there was time for me to ask a question.

Feedback for decision round: I did well on the case portions, was able to demonstrate structure, creativity, and ability to connect the dots.

Did not receive an offer. The interviewer who called said he would have "liked to see more nuance" from my fit answers, that I sounded too rehearsed. This was surprising feedback. The pre-interview practice with a BCG consultant (PL) felt that my fit stories raised additional questions, so I streamlined my responses after the first round interviews. Ultimately, fit is subjective so I was not too disappointed. 

**Takeaway**

I am still unsure whether my fit stories are fundamentally lacking, or if I just had interviewers with different preferences. I reached out to the interviewer who called with a request for additional feedback, although I have yet to hear back.

Based on hearsay online, it seems BCG is slightly more biased (than McK) towards teamwork and interpersonal communication. I prepared my fit stories with the McKinsey PEI categories in mind. If I were to do this over, I would probably clarify and formally articulate my teamwork philosophy/contribution. Otherwise, I am still inclined to agree with former feedback that a structured (albeit "rehearsed") way of storytelling is the better approach. Given five minutes to illustrate an example, I would rather make sure my interviewer understands the crux of my story, even if it is a boring or trivial story, than setting a confusing tone for the rest of the interview.
