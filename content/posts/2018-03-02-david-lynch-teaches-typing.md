<p style="text-align: center;"><i>That typing tutor you like is coming back in style!</i></p>

[**David Lynch Teaches Typing**](https://rhinostew.itch.io/david-lynch-teaches-typing) was released a day or two ago, and I've already played through it three times. It takes less than ten minutes to finish, and it's the same every time, but I get a kick out of it all the same. When I mash out a sequence of F's and J's, pixel Lynch shout-tells me that I am doing beautiful, really beautiful work here.

I had to double check that the David Lynch Voice is impersonated (the game is produced by Rhino Stew and is in no way affiliated with the real David Lynch). His cadence and delivery are nearly spot on. There are many nods to Lynch's oeuvre; I particularly enjoyed typing on the 'Maclaclantosh 900'.

It also made me think of other Lynch tributes I've seen. One could imagine a very different [Star Wars](https://youtu.be/PALjbTo1D5U) under his direction. His daughter directed several commercials to promote David Lynch's Signature Cup Coffee, featuring [Barbie](https://youtu.be/H9DnLa5sAy0) and [industrial German expressionism](https://youtu.be/XSi5XguC34w). Lynch himself made a bizarre 20-minute [instructive video](https://youtu.be/uSP-ewdJYJc) for cooking quinoa, complete with poignant tangent about copper coins and Coca-cola in Yugoslavia.

Successful pastiche relies on a common understanding of what might be considered Lynchian, the answer to which surely involves an unsettling contrast between a thing's content and the style in which it's presented. On one hand, it's easy to pay referential homage to his uniquely iconic imagery: the larval infant, the severed ear, the sibylline midget. On the other hand, certain directorial flourishes -- long tracking takes, sparse ominous dialogue, ambient droning, vague dread -- do more to evoke his hallmark ambiance than any grotesque prop alone. (Combining the two gets you [*Salad Fingers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP6w22ToHgc), which is by far the most Lynchian thing I've seen since *Rabbits*.)

In an essay about *Lost Highway* (a movie that so profoundly impresses me I revisit it once a year), David Foster Wallace suggested [an academic definition of 'Lynchian'](http://www.lynchnet.com/lh/lhpremiere.html): "*the term refers to a particular kind of irony where the very macabre and the very mundane combine in such a way as to reveal the former's perpetual containment within the latter. But like postmodern or pornographic, Lynchian is one of those Porter Stewart-type words that's ultimately definable only ostensively -- i.e., we know it when we see it.*"

> I've noted since 1986, (when *Blue Velvet* was released) that a good 65 percent of the people in metropolitan bus terminals between the hours of midnight and 6 A.M. tend to qualify as Lynchian figures -- grotesque, enfeebled, flamboyantly unappealing, freighted with a woe out of all proportion to evident circumstances ... a class of public-place humans I've privately classed, via Lynch, as 'insistently fucked up.' Or, e.g. we've all seen people assume sudden and grotesque facial expressions -- like when receiving shocking news, or biting into something that turns out to be foul, or around small kids for no particular reason other than to be weird -- but I've determined that a sudden grotesque facial expression won't qualify as a really Lynchian facial expression unless the expression is held for several moments longer than the circumstances could even possibly warrant, until it starts to signify about seventeen different thin sat once.

> (And as an aside, but a true aside, I'll add that I have had a since 1986 personal rule w/r/t dating, which is that any date where I go to a female's residence to pick her up and have any kind of converstaion with parents or roommates that's an even remotly Lynchian conversation is automatically the only date I ever have with that female, regardless of her appeal in other areas. And that this rule, developed after seeing *Blue Velvet*, has seved me remarkably well and kept me out of all kind of hair-raising entanglements and jams, and that friends to whom I've promulgated the rule but who have willfully ignored it and have continued dating females with clear elements of Lynchianism in their characters or associations have done so to their regret.)

DFW is not wrong. You don't leave a Lynch movie the same way you entered. You leave with a keener eye for the intersection of the brutal and the banal around you. Situations, people, and people reacting to situations suddenly all take on Lynchian qualities when you stop to look more closely and for longer than is comfortable. 

It's a shame that Lynch stopped making movies, because they only got weirder and better. He was a master of looking. "*His eyes are good eyes:*", DFW writes upon finally meeting the director. "*He looks at stuff with very intense interest, but it's a warm and fullhearted interest, sort of the way we all look when we're watching somebody we love doing something we also love.*"
