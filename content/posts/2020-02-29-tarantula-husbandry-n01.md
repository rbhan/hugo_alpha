Quarantine is the excuse I needed to fulfill a decade-long ambition.

*Tliltocatl albopilosum*, formerly *B. albopilosum* (reclassified [earlier this year](https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article-abstract/188/1/82/5611858)), is a fluffy, terrestrial, burrowing spider with docile temperament. Adults average around 6" legspan and can live for 5-20 years.

*Grammostola pulchripes* is also a terrestrial burrower. They are considered a good display spider once matured, reaching 8.5" with attractive gold piping (racing stripes?) on each leg and calm confidence to sit in the open. 

# Decisions

* Difficulty or complexity of species care primarily varies between arboreal vs. terrestrial, and Old World vs. New World. Suggested beginner species tend to be terrestrial and New World. Terrestrials seem to tolerate a wider range of humidity conditions (and perhaps prefer drier climates). New World tarantulas are less aggressive and fast-moving; their primary defense is to fling urticating hairs at predators. These are irritating bristles on their abdomen that they brush off with their hind legs when they feel threatened. Old World tarantulas, lacking this defense, are much more aggressive and bite-happy.
* The other key choice is tarantula age, which informs size and gender. It is not straightfoward (even not possible) to sex slings until they molt a couple times. Juveniles/adults can be several times as expensive than slings. Females are uniformly costlier than males because they are larger, live longer, and presumably desired by breeders. Size also limits the type of prey a young spider can kill and eat. Experts caution that spiderlings < 0.5" are almost exclusively scavengers and must be offered cricket drumsticks. I selected for self-sufficent but still unsexed slings.
* [Swift's Invertebrates](http://www.swiftinverts.com/), [Jamie's Tarantulas](https://jamiestarantulas.com/index.php?route=product/category&path=1820_1852/), [Backwater Reptiles](https://www.backwaterreptiles.com/tarantulas-for-sale.html), and [Arachnoiden](https://arachnoiden.com/shop-tarantulas/) are all reputable breeders, and they all had plenty of *albopilosum* and *pulchripes* slings in stock (admittedly rather basic starter Ts).

# Habitation

* Enclosure: 16 oz. deli cup, the top half inch ventilated with a heated nail. Cut out the center of the lid and replaced it with mesh for better ventilation. Added a feeding aperture by punching a hole and fitting it with a webcam slide cover.
* Substrate: Coco coir from a gardening supply shop (as opposed to ordering a brick) so no rehydration was necessary). Added several pinches of peat moss along one edge to hold moisture.
* Hide & decor: (**edit:** the slings spurred my hides entirely, so I probably wouldn't use these again) Half a wine cork hollowed out to create a semi-cylindrical tunnel. Hot-glued some silk leaves over it to wick moisture and add additional shade.
* Water dish: Water bottle caps seem to be recommended choice, but my slings could comfortably sit inside the caps so to reduce drowning risk, I switched to the individual contact lens domes. Buried the edges under the substrate for stability and half-filled the shells.

# Care

* Feeding B. lateralis, the smallest available size, 2-3 times a week.

* Misting 2x a week with a spray bottle, just enough to wet the peat moss and refill the water dish.

# Updates

* 03/07 -- Ordered *B. albopilosum* (0.5-0.75") and *G. pulchripes* (1-1.25"), along with 20 feeders from Jamie's Tarantulas in anticpation of dedicated care capacity while wfh.
* 03/12 -- They arrived! Lightly nestled amidst moist paper towel in glass vials. Gently peeled back the paper towel (taking care not to pull or twist as that could crush the slings) and eased slings into prepared habitats. *G. pulchripes* marched right off the towel and started exploring the hide and water dish immediately. I jostled the albo a little whilst unpacking and it tensed up. I eventually cut out the corner of paper towel it was huddling on, left the whole thing overnight in the enclosure and removed the scrap in the morning.

* 03/20 -- While I haven't spotted the slings eating (or seen any desiccated roach remains), the pinheads do seem to disappear within 24 hours and the slings seem bigger/bristlier than a week ago.
* 03/31 -- Tarantulas have burrowed extensive tunnel systems that allow them to remain out of sight most of the time. They will tentatively come into view, especially in the evenings, but flee at sudden motion or vibrations.
