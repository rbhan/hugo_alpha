*for the full time BCG GAMMA Data Scientist position, my application to the BCG Consultant position was flagged as a good fit for this role*

## Phone screen (8/20)

Half hour call with a Talent Sourcing Lead. We discussed my background, my interest in Gamma, and a previous data science project. Also a good opportunity to get clarification on Gamma's function, the specific role, and details of the interview process (which differs significantly from the traditional BCG application).

## Take-home ML case (8/28-9/1)

Given a take-home case with a business problem, data sets, and several guiding questions, I had five days to solve the problem and submit source code plus a presentation. The project was fairly straightforwards, although I did some additional research about the industry to better understand and inform my recommendations. Solving for a recommendation and preparing the presentation took about 8-10 hours total. Had I wanted to commit more time, I would have liked to create more intuitive visualizations of some of the correlations.

The recruiter followed up later that afternoon with an invitation to present my solution over video.

## Technical case interview (9/13)

Hour long video call with a Senior Data Scientist. Interview started with a 10-15 minute discussion of my background and previous data science experience. Some discussion around how I arrived at my KPIs. Then we had 20-25 minutes to spend on the technical case and my solution; we did not go through the presentation, rather I summarized my recommendations and key insights at a high level, assuming a CFO-level audience. Follow-up questioning probed how I might adjust my recommendations to budget for different profitability considerations, and some more detailed analysis of how I accounted for error tolerance.

I got positive feedback around highlighting my recommendation; having strong business sense and prioritizing actionable items are important to Gamma, since the end client is usually a high-level executive. There was also some time to get insight into the day-to-day job; how teams operate, what projects are like, what kinds of solutions Gamma provides to clients. It sounded like the majourity of Gamma work might be similar to what the take-home case required, but I would need to use Spark/Hadoop frameworks (which I have been wanting to learn for a while!), git/version control to effectively access and manipulate client data. These

The recruited contacted me the next day and invited me to a second interview which would be more like a traditional business case interview for the generalist Consultant role.

## Business case interview (9/21)

Half hour video call with a Project Leader. Quick fit question about a team experience where I had to pivot, followed by a case about growing market share.

# Takeaway

It sounded like there were two more rounds of interviews at a non-local office. The interview process wouldn't finish until early November which was far too late for my timeline.

I like the idea of acquiring more data engineering expertise and getting data science application to business problems, but I don't think Gamma was the best avenue to pursue a data specialization track.

Since the state-of-the-art frameworks and solutions are always evolving (Spark is old news, Scala/Kafka is where it's at now), I can pick these up any time down the road; getting a head start is not necessarily an advantage. I think I will benefit more from spending a few years as a Generalist to get a breadth of perspective and client experience that can, irregardless of industry, accelerate my career down the road.
