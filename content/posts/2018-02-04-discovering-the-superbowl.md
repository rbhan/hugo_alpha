{{< image src="/img/Picasso-Owl-300x247.jpg" position="right" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}} /r/superbowl does not feature discussion about the Super Bowl, as I learned approximately one year ago. Instead, it is a subreddit devoted to superb owls. Mostly photographs, but also owl themed kitsch, drawings, and memes.

I like owls very much, so this was an enormously pleasing find.

Since then, the subreddit has grown exponentially. It currently has more than 140k subscribers. When I stumbled across it last February, in preparation for Super Bowl LI, that count was just shy of 40k subscribers.

The subreddit has been around for about seven years; I can't explain why it has more than tripled in membership within the past year. Perhaps one of the many gifs circulated into the orbit of pop culture/media. Or possibly reddit, and all its boards, gained a boost in mainstream traffic after the 2016 election. Or possibly football is simply declining in popularity (South Park would say so).

I started watching football soon after I subscribed to the /r/superbowl community (only incidentally related). To my surprise, I discovered that I quite enjoy football, as a sport and as a spectacle.

The rules and plays are numerous, at times even arbitrary, but once I got over the details I found the cadence captivating. One team has the football. They have four attempts to advance it 10 yards through (almost) any means necessary. An opposing team just needs to stop them four times, and the ball will fall to their possession.

Yes, it is a pantomime of war. It is also high emotion. The intense physicality is thrilling in and of itself, but risk and sacrifice are also shorthand for worth. These are players determined to give it everything they have, no holds barred, to stop the drive. Their aggression renders the stakes palpable and therefore immersive. Everything can come down to one or two hard-fought inches.

It's not all tackling either; the strategy is quite sophisticated, on both sides of the field. Defense has as much agency to score as offense. Both teams have complete information with which to guess the other's intentions and counter-plan. Every player on the field has a specific, critical job. When everyone executes, the play comes together with mechanical precision.

I don't follow many other sports, and maybe all this is not particular to American football.

Based on what I've seen, though, football is a better metaphor for how I want to approach an initiative, be it working on a project, building new habits, or learning something new. Guided by the big-picture goal, but broken down into one task at a time. Each step planned with thorough yet flexible preparation, and executed with deliberation.

There are many other reasons to enjoy football: the ads, the memes, the tailgating, the collegiate traditions and associated rivalries (irrelevant for my Division III alma mater). But for me, it will always be the vicarious tenacity and concentration of fourth quarter third down in a close game with less than two minutes on the clock.

Besides, appreciation for football was the one thing HST and Nixon agreed on -- if that's not a testament to greatness, nothing is.
