FIDLAR's [latest album](https://open.spotify.com/album/7BJBgg2OqbLnNkuCBaabR3) dropped yesterday and it's the tits.

I don't typically jump on Spotify's New Release updates, but T-minus 26 days out from my defense, _Almost Free_ seemed serendipitously titled.

Stylistically, it's a marked departure from their previous two albums. The lyrics are also more personal and more political than previous subject matter. Which isn’t necessarily bad. Though I'll be the first to begrudge bands that sell-out for a softer, radio-friendly "pop" sound, _Almost Free_ feels part tribute, part experimentation, part introspection.

FIDLAR could continue to only churn out tracks like 'Cheap Beer' or 'Bad Habits', and it would still be enough to fill fan's hearts and concert venues. The new album retains some of that degenerate rage, particularly in 'Alcohol' and 'Too Real', but 'Get Off My Rock' thumps like the Beastie Boys and 'By Myself' has a brassy, twanging groove that's almost Cake. A few tracks don’t quite hit the mark. ‘Can’t You See’ is forgettable; Portugal the Man, washed out. And ‘Called You Twice’ would sound euthanized were it not for K.Flay’s husky vocals. All in all, it’s a new playful side of FIDLAR with less distortion, more real noise rock – the titular track is two instrumental minutes of crunchy bass, raspy drum machines, shrill... sax?

If the eponymous _FIDLAR_ was a snarling bender fueled by cocaine and self-destruction, and _Too_ was alcoholic low tide washing in, then _Almost Free_ is the frantic aftermath of a decade-long binge.

I’d catch them live again, even if their new stuff may have outgrown the moshpit.
