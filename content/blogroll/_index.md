# Individuals
* [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html). All around inspiration: pithy, incisive, assertive, and optimal paragraph text width. Posts on statistics/socioeconomics/startups have broad accessibility and general appeal. 
* [Dan Luu](https://danluu.com/). Long posts, fairly technical, and better suited for desktop reading imo. I always learn something. Fastest loading pages on any internet speed.
* [Eugene Wei](https://www.eugenewei.com). Looong posts with eclectic tangents, but in a good way, like eavesdropping on erudite conversation. Smart takes on movies/entertainment/media. Somewhat (ironically?) hokey artisanal aesthetic.
* [Jeff Kaufmann](https://www.jefftk.com/p/index). Insanely frequent and diverse updates. Super thought-provoking, if impossible to catch up on all the archives.
* [Dan Wang](https://danwang.co/). Deep dives into trends, books, philosophies; like the New Yorker minus their self-serving agenda. Thoughtful perspectives on China/Asia as well. Hard to find previous posts without explicit Archive.
* [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/). Fantastic organization/indexing. Fun gaming.
* [John D. Cook](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/). Often technical, but clearly explained and heavy on application/impact. Answers the "so what" even if "how" isn't clear
* [Moneyness](http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/). Unconventional discourse on monetary economics and markets.
* [AI Weirdness](https://aiweirdness.com/). Very enjoyable, like watching an alien toddler experience the world (or just an ordinary toddler).
